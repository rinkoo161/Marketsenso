"""Point-in-time read guard.

§10: "Point-in-time integrity … enforce this structurally in the data
access layer, not by convention."

The mechanism: analytical reads go through `pit_filings()` (and, in later
phases, pit_* helpers for scores/financials), which REQUIRE an `as_of`
and filter on `observed_at <= as_of`. observed_at is when THIS system
first saw the fact — so a backtest literally cannot see a filing before
the moment we ingested it, whatever its printed date says.

There is no "give me everything" analytical entry point. Live agents pass
as_of=now (a no-op filter); backtests pass the simulated clock. The
poison test in tests/test_pit.py inserts a future-observed row and
asserts a past-as_of read cannot change — that test failing is a build
failure, per the de-risk plan.
