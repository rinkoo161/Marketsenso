"""ms-ingest — the Phase 1 process: A1 poller + document fetcher.

DELIBERATELY single-threaded. All NSE requests (feed polls, document
downloads, list syncs) happen sequentially in one loop, which makes
"never let N agents hammer NSE in parallel" a structural property rather
than a discipline. At 23 feeds and a 30/min budget the loop is idle most
of the time; concurrency would buy nothing but risk.

Each component failure is recorded in agent_runs and does not stop the
loop — a broken feed parser must not stop document draining (§3: agents
survive one another's failure).
